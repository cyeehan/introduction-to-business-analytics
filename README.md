Many businesses, organizations and communities today are discovering the powerful knowledge that comes from analyzing the endlessly renewable resource of Big Data. But analytics is only part of what Big Data offers. An organization gets even greater value by using analytics to serve its customers better through changing how it thinks, works and interacts with them. A smarter enterprise doesn’t stop at merely drawing new insights from Big Data & Analytics. It puts those new insights to work, combining its powerful knowledge with powerful actions

Companies that embrace the full range of opportunities available won’t just gain competitive advantage. They’ll also transform their business models and industries by driving growth in new sectors and new ways. Big data is transforming the competitive environment. With advanced analytics and new data sources, companies in one sector can play a role in the products and services of others, even those far removed from their traditional line of business. This blurs the boundaries between industries and changes competitive dynamics. Companies that transform their business models in parallel with these shifts will find new opportunities for revenue streams, customers, products, and services.

Transformation requires a great deal of change. For both new and existing players, success requires:

•	Having a big data strategy and vision that identifies and capitalizes on new opportunities.
•	Fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation with data.
•	Understanding how to leverage new skills and technologies, and manage the impact they will have on how information is accessed and safeguarded.
•	Building trust with consumers who hold vital data.
•	Creating partnerships within and outside the core industry.
•	Finding ways to gain insight and implement the results quickly.

Businesses have long understood that there's value to be extracted from the massive amounts of data generated every day. Yet for all their enthusiasm, most companies are only scratching the surface of the opportunities that await them. They’re analyzing data for insight, but they have yet to understand the transformative role that data can play in how and where they do business.

You are required to select an appropriate organization that is in business for at least 3 years. Discuss the company background and business operation of the company. Identify the current problem and challenges endured by the organisation. You may also identify prospects of improvement to the organisation by introducing analytics. Research and write a report on how this organization can successfully implement state-of-the-art analytics solution and information technologies related to business analytics which would result in improvement of their business processes, organizational transformation, higher productivity, business growth, enhanced competitiveness, to have more effective managerial decision making and increased globalization opportunities. 

The organization selected may be companies incorporated in Malaysia or multinational companies. From the selected organization, identify and describe analytical solution which could be implemented in the organization. Analyse and discuss the benefits and business transformations that these proposed solutions may bring to the organization. The proposed solution or business analytical model should be referenced from reputable journals, white papers, business case studies or valid academic references. You should be able to propose recommendation with regards to any mode of business transformation, business process improvement, CRM, Supply Chain Management or any relevant scope where analytic solution would value add to the business.
