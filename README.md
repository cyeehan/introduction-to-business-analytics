## ðŸš¨ Issue


### 1. `Missing write access to .../node_modules`?

Run this command: `sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

- `sudo` means running the command as the system super user, root user.
- `chown` changes the owner of the file or folder.
- `-R` changes the owner, so that we can get root access to all files inside the node_modules folder.
- `$USER` is an environment variable, and by default it is your system username.
- Finally, you can `npm install -g json-server`.


## `db.json`
